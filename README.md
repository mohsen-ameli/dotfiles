## Github

To add ssh support for ease of use to login and use github, first do the following.
`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"`
This will generate an id_rsa and id_rsa.pub files in the ~/.ssh folder.
Then run these two commands:
`eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`
`ssh-add ~/.ssh/whatever-you-named-id_rsa`
Then copy the public `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` and open a browser and go to github.com > settings > ssh and gpg keys > new ssh key and paste the
public id rsa in there.
Now you can clone and use any repos you have.

NOTE: when cloning, use the ssh option when you press on "Code".
NOTE: If you have multiple ssh keys, make a "config" file (just name it config in ~/.ssh), and put the following per account

```
# Personal
Host github.com
HostName github.com
PreferredAuthentications publickey
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal
```

### Remote origin url

To view the origin url of a git directory run:
`git remote -v`

To change the origin url run:
`git remote set-url origin new-url`

## Secure Boot

If dual booting, make sure to have windows's Bitlock password.
Then go to bios and remove secure boot keys (aka put into setup mode)
Then do the following:

```shell
sudo pacman -S sbctl
sudo sbctl status # Make sure you are in setup mode
sudo sbctl create-keys
sudo sbctl enroll-keys -m
sudo sbctl sign -s -o /usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/systemd-bootx64.efi.signed /usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/systemd-bootx64.efi
sudo sbctl sign -s <path-to-kernel> # path to kernel for me was /boot/vmlinuz-linux-lts
sudo sbctl sign -s <path-to-boot-manager> # path to boot manager for me was /boot/efi/EFI/GRUB/grubx64.EFI
sudo bootctl install
sudo sbctl verify # make sure it's all green
```

## Xorg

## General Notes

To check which apps are running on XWayland, run `xlsclients` or `xeyes`

To force an app to use wayland, add this line to the "exec" option of the app
found in either `/usr/share/applications` or `/usr/share/local/applications`:\
`--enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland`

If the system clock is messed up, run the following to enable network based time
`sudo timedatectl set-ntp 1`

Connect to WiFi automatically with nmcli
`nmcli connection modify SSID connection.autoconnect yes`

Connecting to eduroam:
go to https://cat.eduroam.org/
select the university/college you go to and download the executable python script.
run it, and try to connect now (I had success with nmtui).

Run apps as sudo on hyprland\
`xhost si:localuser:root`\
`xhost | DISPLAY=:0 sudo command`

### Pacman

If having issues with updating packages with pacman, or if you're getting keyring/"unkown trust" issues,
do the following
`sudo pacman-key --init`
`sudo pacman-key --populate`
`sudo pacman -S archlinux-keyring`

If there's a dependancy issue with 2 conflicting packages, 
you could either add the packages involved to the "IgnorePkg=" list in `/etc/pacman.conf`.
Or you could try installing both conflicting packages with `sudo pacman -S pkg1 pkg2`.
Or you could downgrade (not a very good option).
Or perhaps wait for the arch team to resolve the issu.

### Cleaning system (Arch)

Run `pacman-mange --clear-cache` inside `~/.local/bin/`.
Run `gdu / -i /media,/run/timeshift` to get file sizes.
`/opt` usually has external programs, maybe check that out.
`~/.cache` might have some things to clean up.
`~/.local` is where all the steam games are, so check that out.

## Cool Things

Use `fbgrab <image>.png` to take a picture of the tty

Use `mpv <video or image or url>` to view videos or images (this works on the tty as well).
Can use `timg` if tty is iffy.

Use `yt-dlp <url>` to download any video online (including YouTube).

## PostgreSQL

If you're having trouble try restarting postgresql, or reininstalling it.
You can also nuke the folders containing postgres (WARNING: this will remove everything!!!).
`sudo rm -rf /var/lib/postgres/`

Switch to the postgres user
`sudo su postgres`
Then make a new user (call it the same as your main user's name)
`createuser --interactive`
Exit

To make a new database:
`createdb <db-name>`
You can also use -h <server>
-p <port>

Connect to it:
`psql -d boomerang`

## fonts and icons

Downloads fonts into either /usr/share/fonts or .local/share/fonts
use sudo fc-cache -fv to install all fonts
use fc-list to list the installed fonts
fc-list : family style
edit .config/fontconfig/fonts.conf to use different fonts:

## Nvidia

If the drivers are not working, make a file `/etc/modprobe.d/nvidia.conf`
and put the following in it:

```
options nvidia_drm modeset=1 fbdev=1
options nvidia NVreg_PreserveVideoMemoryAllocations=1 NVreg_TemporaryFilePath=/var/tmp
```

and `/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf`

```
blacklist nouveau
options nouveau modeset=0
```

### GPU Passthrough

Run `lspci -nn` you can also use grep to filter. `lspci -nn | grep NVIDIA`.
Note the values inside brackets [] at the end.
Grab the card's id as well as the video device's id associated with it.
Go to `/etc/modprobe.d/` and make a file `vfio.conf` (or whatever else you'd like)
Paste the following into it:

```
options vfio-pci ids=10de:2520,10de:228e
softdep nvidia pre: vfio-pci
```

Replaces ids with your card's ids.
Run `sudo mkinitcpio -P`

To check if you're in vfio mode, run `lspci -k | grep NVIDIA -A3`
And see if the "kernel in use" is set to "vfio-pci"

Next go in virtual manager and open the configuration for the vm. Add hardware and select "PCI Host device".
Then select your graphics card to add it, then finish.

## Games

To better run games on steam, the following settings can be changed located in `(gear icon in any game) > properties > general > launch options`

Generally I use gamescope and gamemoderun to solve common issues:

`gamescope -W 1920 -H 1080 -r 144 -- gamemoderun %command%`

Games with easy anti-cheat

## udev rules

This is to have notifications when the battery hits a certain percent, to tell you to plug the power.

Go in /etc/udev/rules.d and create two files. (replace USERNAME with your username). This will make sure to give notifications whenever a device is plugged or unplugged in (as well as charging/discharging).

power.rules:

```properties
ACTION=="change", SUBSYSTEM=="power_supply", ATTR{type}=="Mains", ATTR{online}=="0", ENV{DISPLAY}=":0", ENV{XAUTHORITY}="/home/USERNAME/.Xauthority" RUN+="/usr/bin/su USERNAME -c '/home/USERNAME/.local/bin/battery-charging discharging'"
ACTION=="change", SUBSYSTEM=="power_supply", ATTR{type}=="Mains", ATTR{online}=="1", ENV{DISPLAY}=":0", ENV{XAUTHORITY}="/home/USERNAME/.Xauthority" RUN+="/usr/bin/su USERNAME -c '/home/USERNAME/.local/bin/battery-charging charging'"
```

usb.rules:

```properties
ACTION=="add",SUBSYSTEM=="usb",ENV{DISPLAY}=":0", ENV{XAUTHORITY}="/home/USERNAME/.Xauthority" RUN+="/usr/bin/su USERNAME -c '/home/USERNAME/.local/bin/usb-notify 1 %E{DEVNAME}'"
ACTION=="remove",SUBSYSTEM=="usb",ENV{DISPLAY}=":0", ENV{XAUTHORITY}="/home/USERNAME/.Xauthority" RUN+="/usr/bin/su USERNAME -c '/home/USERNAME/.local/bin/usb-notify 0 %E{DEVNAME}'"
```

## Unix Password Manager

Install pass

`sudo pacman -S pass pass-otp`

### Setup for firefox

`sudo pacman -S passff-host`

`curl -sSL https://codeberg.org/PassFF/passff-host/releases/download/latest/install_host_app.sh | bash -s -- librewolf`

### Setup for chrome

Download extention: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chrome-pass-zx2c4/oblajhnjmknenodebpekmkliopipoolo 

Github page for the host python package: https://github.com/hsanson/chrome-pass

`pipx install chrome-pass==1.0.1`

`chrome_pass install`

### Export GPG keys

Run this to first see a list of keys
`gpg --list-keys`
Then find the one that you need (usually the email you used to make the keys)
Then copy the line under pub.
Eeport public key.
`gpg --export -a KEY_HERE > subkey.pub`
Export private key
`gpg --export-secret-subkeys -a KEY_HERE > subkey`

## Tor Browser

To connect to a specific country, you must specify it in the "ExitNodes" like this:

```
EntryNodes {ca} StrictNodes 1
ExitNodes {it},{de} StrictNodes 1
```

Add this to "torrc" file, in windows it is located in the default tor folder
and in linux it is in /etc/tor/torrc-defaults

1 means it is forced

0 means it can also use other nodes, if they one specified does not work.

In windows go to internet options > connections > LAN settings > Advanced and make sure "Use the same proxy server ..."
is checked off, then delete everything and add this to socks (last option):
socks: localhost port: 9050
